swissdutch
==========

A Python implementation of the Dutch pairing system for Swiss tournaments.

Usage
-----

.. code:: python

    from swissdutch.dutch import DutchPairingEngine
    from swissdutch.constants import FideTitle, Colour, FloatStatus
    from swissdutch.player import Player

    engine  = DutchPairingEngine()
    input_players = (
            Player(name='Alice',
                   rating=2500,
                   title=FideTitle.GM,
                   pairing_no=1,
                   score=1,
                   float_status=FloatStatus.none,
                   opponents=(8,),
                   colour_hist=(Colour.white,)),
            Player(name='Bruno',
                   rating=2500,
                   title=FideTitle.IM,
                   pairing_no=2,
                   score=1,
                   float_status=FloatStatus.none,
                   opponents=(9,),
                   colour_hist=(Colour.black,)),
            # ... further cards omitted for brevity
    )
    result_players = engine.pair_round(2, input_players)

Status
------

Alpha. All the rules of the Dutch system have been implemented except for
**D.4** which specifies the correct procedure to obtain the best pairings in
homogenous remainder brackes. See issue #1. I hope to implement this soon.
