swissdutch
==========

A Python implementation of the Dutch pairing system for Swiss tournaments.

Usage
-----

.. code:: python

    from swissdutch.dutch import DutchPairingEngine
    from swissdutch.constants import FideTitle, Colour, FloatStatus
    from swissdutch.pairing import PairingCard

    engine  = DutchPairingEngine()
    input_cards = (
            PairingCard(name='Alice',
                        rating=2500,
                        title=FideTitle.GM,
                        pairing_no=1,
                        score=1,
                        float_status=FloatStatus.none,
                        opponents=(8,),
                        colour_hist=(Colour.white,)),
            PairingCard(name='Bruno',
                        rating=2500,
                        title=FideTitle.IM,
                        pairing_no=2,
                        score=1,
                        float_status=FloatStatus.none,
                        opponents=(9,),
                        colour_hist=(Colour.black,)),
            # ... further cards omitted for brevity
    )
    result_cards = engine.pair_round(2, input_cards)

Status
------

Pre-alpha. At this stage the library is not yet usable since the following
functionality has not yet been implemented. Watch this space!

1. Exchanges (partially implemented)
2. Backtracking
3. Lowering requirements (partially implemented)
4. Exceptions for top scorers in the last round
