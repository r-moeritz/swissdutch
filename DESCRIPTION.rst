Dutch Pairing System for Swiss Tournaments
==========================================

The Dutch is a pairing system for tournaments in the Swiss format. Although
designed to be used for chess tournaments, it may prove useful for other types
of games using the Swiss tournament format, e.g. *Magic: The Gathering (tm)*.

The focus in the Dutch system is on two aspects, in descending priority:

1. Pairing players with similar scores
2. Allocating colours in a fair manner

Mario Held has written an excellent [turorial](http://www.tinyurl.com/held2014)
on the Dutch system in which he guides the reader through its implementation
for an example 5 round tournament. He also provides an annotated copy of the
FIDE Dutch rules in an appendix.
